## Heading 2 ##

EMAP Visualizer creates bar and pie graphs for reporting purposes from the CSV output of EMAP - A project of Philippine Genome Center's 2018 Internship.

**Input**

It can take the following as input:
* EMAP's cellular component annotations
* EMAP's mollecular function annotations
* EMAP's biological processes annotations
* EMAP's combined cellular component, mollecular function, and biological processes annotations

**Output**

It can output the following graphs:

* Bar graphs of the top 20 annotations with the most number of gene count hits per annotation domain
* Pie graphs of the top 20 annotations with the most number of gene count hits per annotation domain
* A combined bar graph of the top 20 annotations of the three domains
